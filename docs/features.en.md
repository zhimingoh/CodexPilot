# CodexPilot Feature Guide

This guide explains what each CodexPilot page does, which local data it reads or writes, and which operations should be previewed before writing changes. The README stays focused on the homepage and quick entry points; full feature details live here.

## Launch And Injection

CodexPilot starts a supported desktop host through a local launcher and connects to the renderer through Chromium DevTools Protocol. Current builds support the Codex workflow inside ChatGPT desktop and retain compatibility with the legacy standalone Codex host. After injection succeeds, a CodexPilot action menu appears inside the selected page.

If ChatGPT or legacy Codex is already running through another path, the manager will suggest re-injection or restart based on the current state. Restarting asks for confirmation first so unsaved input is not closed unexpectedly.

The Launch page also includes Page Enhancement switches for visible injected features:

- Timeline
- Inline export and delete actions
- Scroll restore
- Plugin Entry Unlock
- Force Plugin Install

`Plugin Entry Unlock` is meant for API-key usage without ChatGPT login on hosts that still expose the legacy Codex plugin UI. When enabled, CodexPilot unlocks the native plugin entry in the current page. `Force Plugin Install` re-enables certain install buttons that were disabled by `App unavailable`.

These enhancements only affect the injected page behavior for the current running desktop host. They do not replace ccSwitch, and they do not manage Provider switching or API keys in `~/.codex/config.toml`. Page-specific hooks that are missing in a newer ChatGPT desktop build are skipped and reported through diagnostics.

When plugin entry unlock is active, the native Codex sidebar shows `Plugins - Unlocked`.

## Session Export And Maintenance

CodexPilot can add extra actions to regular and archived sessions:

- export Markdown;
- delete sessions;
- briefly undo deletion;
- view, restore, or permanently clean deleted backups;
- batch-delete archived sessions.

Delete and restore operations read and write the local Codex session database. CodexPilot keeps recoverable backups where possible, but you should still review session contents before batch cleanup.

## Timeline

In the current Codex conversation, when CodexPilot detects at least two user prompts, it shows a lightweight Timeline near the right edge of the page. Each marker represents one user prompt. Hover to preview the prompt text, or click a marker to scroll that prompt into the center of the viewport.

Timeline only reads the current page content. It does not write session files, state databases, or configuration files. If the current page is not a conversation, the session cannot be detected, or there are not enough user prompts, Timeline hides itself automatically.

## Dialog Sync

After ccSwitch or another tool changes `model_provider` in `~/.codex/config.toml`, old sessions may be hidden or grouped incorrectly because their `model_provider` metadata differs. To normalize the history, open Dialog Maintenance and click `Sync All Dialogs`. CodexPilot reads the current configured Provider when the operation runs and assigns all local active and archived history to it; there is no target selection, impact-preview step, or second confirmation.

Sync remains an explicit maintenance action. It does not run automatically after a Provider switch, configuration save, desktop-host launch, or page refresh. After switching Providers, click `Sync All Dialogs` again when the full local history should follow the new current Provider.

Sync scope:

- `~/.codex/sessions/**/rollout-*.jsonl`
- `~/.codex/archived_sessions/**/rollout-*.jsonl`
- `~/.codex/state_5.sqlite`
- `~/.codex/.codex-global-state.json`

Backup location:

```text
~/.codex/backups_state/provider-sync/
```

## Diagnostics

The manager shows checks for launch, injection, dialog sync, and page connection state. It can also export diagnostic logs for troubleshooting or issue reports.

Diagnostics are mainly used to check:

- whether the desktop host path is usable and which host kind was selected;
- whether the debug port and helper port are healthy;
- whether the page has connected and injection has completed;
- whether page-specific hooks such as the Fast dispatcher are available;
- whether local data required by dialog maintenance and dialog sync is accessible.

## Local Data And Security

CodexPilot reads or writes these local paths:

- `~/.codex/config.toml`: read-only current `model_provider` source for dialog sync defaults.
- `~/.codex/sessions/`: session metadata and export sources.
- `~/.codex/archived_sessions/`: archived session metadata and export sources.
- `~/.codex/state_5.sqlite`: session index, delete, restore, and dialog sync.
- `~/.codex/backups_state/provider-sync/`: dialog sync backups.
- CodexPilot's own app state directory: launch preferences, page enhancement settings, and diagnostic logs.

Use CodexPilot only on trusted devices, and avoid uploading local config, logs, screenshots, or backup directories to public repositories. Model Provider switching and API key management should be handled by ccSwitch or your own Codex configuration flow; CodexPilot only reads the current `model_provider` as the default target for dialog sync.

CodexPilot also uses a local loopback debug port and a local helper port. Chromium DevTools Protocol connections can execute page scripts, so use CodexPilot only in a trusted local environment.

Additional data locations:

- `~/.codex/.codex-pilot-undo/`: undo/recycle-bin backups created after deleting sessions.

## Compatibility

CodexPilot depends on ChatGPT desktop or legacy Codex page structure and local Codex data format. If ChatGPT desktop changes its renderer structure, route metadata, request dispatcher, session database, or configuration format, CodexPilot may need updates to its page connection scripts or sync logic. The intended maintenance path is to keep the desktop host compatibility layer small, preserve legacy Codex behavior, and let page-specific enhancements degrade gracefully when a hook is unavailable.
