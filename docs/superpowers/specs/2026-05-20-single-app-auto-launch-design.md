# Single App Auto Launch Design

## Status

Active with one constraint: automatic launch is an opt-in manager preference,
not the default startup behavior. CodexPilot remains one visible app and
`codex-pilot-launcher` remains an internal sidecar. The manager may trigger the
same launch command used by the manual button after startup, but only when no
Codex window is already running.

## Goal

CodexPilot should remain one visible product. Users should not see a second
CodexPilot launcher app or have to choose between two similar entries. The
daily path should be: open CodexPilot, let it start and inject Codex
automatically, and only show management UI when the user needs configuration or
when startup fails.

## Non-Goals

- Do not add a second `.app`, desktop shortcut, or Start menu product entry.
- Do not rename the existing product.
- Do not replace the existing manual "launch Codex" workflow.
- Do not hide failures silently.

## User Experience

The manager remains the explicit entry point for launch and configuration. The
Launch page includes an "auto launch on open" switch, saved with the same launch
preferences as app path and ports.

When the switch is off, opening CodexPilot only refreshes status. Users launch,
reinject, restart, and save preferences from the manager UI.

When the switch is on, opening CodexPilot first checks whether a usable Codex
installation path can be resolved. If not, the manager stays visible and does
nothing automatically. If Codex is installed, the manager then checks runtime
state and chooses one conservative automatic action:

- Codex not running: automatically start Codex once.
- Codex already running with a reachable debug port: automatically inject once.
- Codex already running without a reachable debug port: do not restart
  automatically; keep the manager visible and require manual confirmation for
  restart.

If an automatic launch or injection attempt fails once, the current manager
process must not automatically retry again.

## Architecture

Keep the existing `codex-pilot-launcher` binary as an internal sidecar. It
continues to own provider sync, Codex process startup, helper startup, and page
injection.

The Tauri manager owns the product entry point and launch preferences. On app
startup, it loads preferences and exposes the current launch snapshot. The
snapshot includes the auto-launch preference so the frontend can decide whether
to trigger the existing backend launch command once.

The frontend should not duplicate launch logic. It should call backend commands
for explicit launch/reinject actions and for one conservative automatic action
chosen from the launch snapshot. It must not call restart automatically when a
Codex window is already running without a reachable debug port.

The launch snapshot implementation should avoid repeated synchronous subprocess
checks on high-frequency window events. Runtime state probes should be async on
the backend, use a short-lived cache to collapse repeated checks, and keep
focus-triggered manager refresh rate-limited on the frontend.

## Startup Flow

1. Manager starts normally.
2. Backend loads launch preferences for app path and ports.
3. Frontend receives `launch_snapshot`.
4. If `autoLaunchOnOpen` is off, no automatic launch is attempted.
5. If `autoLaunchOnOpen` is on, the frontend triggers at most one automatic
   action per manager process:
   - no usable Codex installation path: stop and show the manager.
   - helper already running: mark as running and do not spawn another launcher.
   - debug port reachable: automatically inject once.
   - no Codex running: spawn the sidecar launcher once.
   - unrelated Codex already running without debug port: surface the current
     "restart required" state instead of killing it automatically.
6. If the automatic action fails, record that failure in the running manager
   process and do not automatically retry again.
7. Manual launch keeps handling all cases, including the confirmed restart path.
8. On failure, the manager stays visible and shows the error.

Manager refresh triggered by `focus` and `visibilitychange` should remain
conservative and lightweight. Those events may refresh state, but should not
burst-fire direct blocking process checks every time the window focus toggles.

## Error Handling

Launch must be conservative. It must not close or restart an existing Codex
process without explicit user confirmation.

Errors should be written to the existing diagnostic log. The launch view should
show the latest failure message in the same style as manual launch failures.

If the app path is missing or invalid, auto launch should not loop. It should
show the manager and let the user fix the path.

If Codex is already running without the configured debug port, auto launch must
not call restart. It should show the manager and keep the existing confirmation
flow on the manual button.

## Packaging

Packaging remains single-product:

- macOS DMG contains only `CodexPilot.app`.
- Windows installer keeps one product entry for CodexPilot.
- `codex-pilot-launcher` remains bundled as an internal sidecar only.

No user-facing launcher app, shortcut, or second product name is added.

## Testing

- Unit-test launch preference serialization.
- Verify opening the manager does not launch Codex automatically when the switch
  is off.
- Verify opening the manager launches Codex once when the switch is on and no
  Codex window is running.
- Verify opening the manager automatically injects once when Codex is already
  running with a reachable debug port.
- Verify opening the manager does not restart an unrelated running Codex.
- Verify opening the manager does not attempt automatic launch or injection when
  no usable Codex installation path is available.
- Verify one failed automatic launch or injection attempt is not retried again
  during the same manager process lifetime.
- Keep the frontend auto-launch decision in a small unit-tested module so these
  branches can be checked without spawning Codex.
- Verify the existing manual launch button still works.
- Verify failure states keep the manager visible and write diagnostics.
- Run existing Rust tests and renderer injection tests.
